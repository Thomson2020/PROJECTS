# PROJECTS

DEBUGGING FOR
#QM - CHECK IF CORRECT

#DFT OF AUDIO FILE(for audio sampling with fft and dft run in local ide)

#FFT OF IMAGE (MP PROJECT) not sure if that much enough or needs more work on it

#DIP NOISE REDUC is a bit dicey cus only nlm is showing best reduction filtering others should be doing it too I think, kernel issue maybe(whole code needs to be run in local ide)

#Spherical is done mostly, if anything is out of place point out(animation can only be run in local ide)
